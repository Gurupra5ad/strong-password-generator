30 DAY Challenge -  DAY 6

As a part of day 6 challenge in my 30 days = 30 projects challenge, I am going to code a strong password generator based on the inputs user give. The user can select two options at the starting which will ask whether the user want to create a random password or make their inputs stronger enough to have a unhackable password.
